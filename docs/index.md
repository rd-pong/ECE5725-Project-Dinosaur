# Requirements
The Final Project report will be a web site which will be included on the course page

Report should include sections as outlined below.  Lab reports for the course provide a good guideline for the final project report.
Sections of the Report should include the following:
Header: Includes Project Title, date, and names and netids of teammates
Objective:  A succinct (3-4 line) summary of your problem statement
Project Video:  Please link the standard placeholder video toy your website: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuM8vTq0jd4 (Links to an external site.)

You will create a ~2 minute video to be loaded to a Cornell Box site
This video will be uploaded to the class youtube page
Once uploaded, we will edit your web site and replace the included video with your project video
Introduction: Short description of what was done for the project.
Design and Testing: Include design steps involved in the project. Please include any issues you experienced as well as well as smooth progress in the various phases of your project. Describe testing you performed to confirm that development steps of the project performed as planned.
Results: Did everything perform as planned? Did your team meet the goals outlined in the description?
Conclusions: What results did you project achieve?  What did you discover that definitely did not work?
Future work:  What would you explore if you had more time to work on the project?
Budget: Include a budget / list of parts / bill of materials
References: cite any source material you used for your project.  This list could include:
Student project sites you consulted
data sheets for parts you used
References you discovered online
Papers or text book
Source material from the class
ANYTHING else you used to accomplish your work
Code Appendix
Include code listings in this section
Optionally, include a link to a code repository
Note:  All project code must be accessable  
Drawings, figures, and graphs should be included in all sections to support your work
Please include sections detailing contributions by each team member.  Sections can (and should) be written by each team member    
include a team photo in your web page.
Plan to include everything in the report; for example:
code listings
design ideas
photos/drawings....including early sketches
dead ends and failed experiments
......if in doubt about any material, add it!
Additional Tips:

Include Code Headers and code comments
Photos and figures with figure legends
Make sure fonts are readable
Proof Read!  and Spellcheck!
Check all 'clicks' on your web site (including off-site links, photos, and figures)
Please refer to past student projects at skovira.ece.cornell.edu for practical examples, ideas, and guidelines.  

For creating the web site:

You should create Standards Compliant HTML. It should pass the W3C validation located at http://validator.w3.org/ (Links to an external site.).
Your top page should be named 'index.html'
No external hot linking of images.
Please be aware of copyright issues. Credit an image if you have permissions to borrow it.
Place all images in a separate folder, preferably /img .
Place all CSS and scripts (if any) in a separate folder.
You can include flash videos and animations but the report itself cannot be flash.
Note:  Please check your final site for mismatches in html *.jpg and file *.JPG : the case mismatch for file extensions will cause issues with figure rendering in some browsers.
Tools for web site creation:

You can used Dreamweaver (a 30-day free license) to create your web site
The TAs created sample web templates (see canvas links).  Please feel free to use these example and change as needed.
You may use web page creation utilities you may already be familiar with as long as you can obtain source HTML from these sites.
Submission of Report

Report will be due TWO days after your demo (in general)
Once you are finished with your report, zip all files into a file named 'Lab_group_name.zip'
Upload the final zip file to the Canvas assignment link
